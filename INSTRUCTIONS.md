# Assessment

We would like you to style up the "index.html" page to match the "design.png" mockup included in this project. We have also included specific instructions below and within the "index.html" file itself which should be followed and completed.

This assessment is designed to try and help us understand what level you are at for HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and debugging!), and so asks you to do some things which you may not normally need to. If you get stuck at any point or have questions, please ask!

## Checklist

1. Change the logo to use "logo-home.png" from here => https://www.conscious.co.uk/

2. Include "Lato" from Google fonts (Find it here => https://fonts.google.com/)

3. Make the top navigation "sticky" so that it is fixed to the top of the browser window

4. Try to use CSS to show/hide the sub-menu dropdowns (animating this is a bonus)

5. Create 2 columns within the #main element (a main centre column and a right sidebar column). This should collapse down to a single column on mobile size devices

6. Use JavaScript to move the staff rotator content to the right column (so in the Page Source, this should remain in the #footer)

7. Use bxSlider to create a rotating list of staff members, with a "pager" underneath that will rotate through the staff member names. Use the image src to generate the links/text for each link

8. Add in the Twitter icon to the "social icons" block in the Footer

9. Your site should be fully responsive, so components will collapse down and stack on smaller devices
