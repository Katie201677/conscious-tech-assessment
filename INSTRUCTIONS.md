# Assessment

We would like you to style up the "index.html" page to match the "design.png" mockup included in this project. We have also included specific instructions below and within the "index.html" file itself which should be followed and completed.

KW: this is most of the way there but if I had more time I would sort out the alignment of the different sections which isn't quite right as per the design. 

This assessment is designed to try and help us understand what level you are at for HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and debugging!), and so asks you to do some things which you may not normally need to. If you get stuck at any point or have questions, please ask!

## Checklist

1. Change the logo to use "logo-home.png" from here => https://www.conscious.co.uk/

KW: done and image centered using dispay block and left and right auto margins. 

2. Include "Lato" from Google fonts (Find it here => https://fonts.google.com/)

KW: added google font in head tag. 

3. Make the top navigation "sticky" so that it is fixed to the top of the browser window

KW: nav positioned using position fixed so that it stays at the top.

4. Try to use CSS to show/hide the sub-menu dropdowns (animating this is a bonus)

KW: submenus display on hover with fade-in animation. I have not had chance to look at this on mobile, but would have potentially looked at a different solution for mobile where the whole menu expands from a hamburger icon.

5. Create 2 columns within the #main element (a main centre column and a right sidebar column). This should collapse down to a single column on mobile size devices

KW: done with grid. The layout collapses to a single column a media query. If I had more time I would sort out the column widths as they do not stay in the right proportions at the moment. 

6. Use JavaScript to move the staff rotator content to the right column (so in the Page Source, this should remain in the #footer)

KW: done in site.js.

7. Use bxSlider to create a rotating list of staff members, with a "pager" underneath that will rotate through the staff member names. Use the image src to generate the links/text for each link

KW: I have had a go at this but it is not quite there. I haven't worked with jQuery before and am very happy to get up to speed but didn't have time this week! I have got some of the way there from the docs/google and some vanilla JS but haven't managed to link up the scroll to the names in the time I've had. I also haven't had chance to get my head around styling so it doesn't look quite as per the design. 

8. Add in the Twitter icon to the "social icons" block in the Footer

KW: I have added in the icons for all socials although with more time I would tidy up the positioning (I have used background offset to show the relevant part of the social icons file, but it is not quite there).

9. Your site should be fully responsive, so components will collapse down and stack on smaller devices

KW: I have made a start at responsiveness with some media queries but would do more work on this with more time. The alignment of the various sections is not right at all screen sizes and the nav bar would need amending for mobile as mentioned above.
